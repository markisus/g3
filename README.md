# g3
A library for the Geometric Algebra of the Vector Space R^3

Included are implementations for vectors (3d), quaternions (4d), bivectors (3d, quaternions without the scalar part), multivectors (8d).

These quantities can be freely combined with additions and multiplications under the usual rules of geometric algebra. Additionally, you can divide by vectors, quaternions, and bivectors.
